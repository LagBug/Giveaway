# Giveaways
Giveaways is the first actual minecraft giveaway system. It is inspired by the GiveawaysBot from discord and it aims to help server owners keep an active community by rewarding their players through giveaways. The players only have to enter a giveaway either by a command or a beautiful gui. The plugin will then take care of everything else and reward the winners.

## Prerequisites
- Java 8 or above.
- A spigot server running any version above 1.8

## Installation
In order to intall and get this plugin to work in your server, you'll first have to buy it from https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/giveaways.63932/. You can then find a more documented guide here https://github.com/LagBug/Giveaways/wiki/Installation
